AWS Signature version 4:
- When you send HTTP requests to AWS services, you (or your client tool/SDK) sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. 
- You sign requests with your AWS access key, which consists of an access key ID and secret access key.
- Some requests do not need to be signed, such as anonymous requests to Amazon S3.

Envelope encryption:
- Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting plaintext data with a data key, and then encrypting the data key under another key. 
- The latter key can also be encrypted under a third key, and so on.
- Eventually, one key must remain in plaintext so you can decrypt the keys and your data. 
- This top-level plaintext encryption key is known as the master key. 

AWS Key Management Service (KMS):
- A fully managed service to create and manage cryptographic keys.
- You can create symmetric or asymmetric keys.
